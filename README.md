**Statistical Analysis with Agentic AI: A Hands-On Exploration**

As statistical analysts, we live at the intersection of data and insight, meticulously crafting code to transform raw numbers into meaningful stories. But what if we could elevate this craft with AI agents—autonomous, role-specific collaborators that write, validate, and refine our code? Welcome to the world of Agentic AI, a paradigm where AI doesn’t just assist but actively participates in our workflows. I’m an analyst with years of hands-on experience in stats and AI, and I’m thrilled to introduce you to this game-changer. In this post, we’ll explore a Python program I’ve built using Google’s Generative AI and Pandas, where two agents—a Programmer and a Validator—team up to derive columns like age categories and smoking indicators. We’ll dissect a real execution log, map their collaboration with a flow diagram, and see why Agentic AI is tailor-made for us. Plus, I’ll highlight how we can tweak thresholds like code similarity and iteration limits to fit our needs—giving us control over this powerful tool. Let’s dive into this blend of innovation and practicality, designed for analysts like us.



**The Goal: What Are We Trying to Do?**
Imagine a demographic dataset with columns like SubjectID, DateOfBirth, StudyDate, and SmokingStatus. Our task is to add derived columns based on specific rules:

- AgeCategory: Sort subjects into "Child," "Adult," or "Senior" by age.

- IsSmokerIndicator: Flag them as "Yes" or "No" based on smoking history.

We’d typically code this ourselves, test it, and refine it. Here, Agentic AI steps in with:

- A Programmer Agent to draft the Python code.

- A Validator Agent to ensure the output matches the spec.

It’s an iterative process—defaulting to two tries per column—but we can adjust that cap and other thresholds like code similarity to suit our projects.


**The Strategy: How It Comes Together**
Picture a seasoned coder and a sharp-eyed reviewer working in tandem:

1. Inputs: A dataset (`data.csv`) and a rulebook (`specification.txt`).

2. Collaboration:

   - The Programmer writes code for a column.

   - The Validator independently codes the same logic, compares outputs, and provides feedback if they differ.

   - If they match, they move on. If not, the Programmer refines it.

3. Outputs: Final code is saved, and every step is logged.

This mirrors our debug-and-test cycle, with customizable limits—say, tweaking the 60% code similarity threshold or iteration count—to balance independence and efficiency.


**The Flow: Step-by-Step**
Here’s the rundown:

1. **Setup**: Creates a sample dataset and reads the rules.

2. **Agent Interaction**:

   - Programmer drafts code.

   - Validator checks it against its own version.

   - If outputs align, they proceed. If not, they retry (up to our set limit).

3. **Output**: Code is saved, and the process is logged.
