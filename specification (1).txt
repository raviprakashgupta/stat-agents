# Specification for Demographic Dataset Column Derivations

## Column: AgeCategory

Description: Categorizes subjects into age groups based on their calculated age.

Logic/Algorithm:
1. Calculate Age: Subtract 'Date of Birth' from 'Study Date' to get age in years. Assume dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format.
2. Age Categories:
  - If Age < 18, Category = "Child"
  - If 18 <= Age < 55, Category = "Adult"
  - If Age >= 55, Category = "Senior"

Input Data:
- Columns: 'Date of Birth', 'Study Date' (Assume columns exist in DM dataset)

Example:
- Date of Birth: 1995-03-15
- Study Date: 2024-08-20
- Age (Calculation): 2024 - 1995 = 29
- AgeCategory (Result): "Adult"


## Column: IsSmokerIndicator

Description: Indicates if a subject is a smoker based on smoking status.

Logic/Algorithm:
- If 'Smoking Status' is "Current Smoker" or "Former Smoker", then IsSmokerIndicator = "Yes"
- Otherwise, IsSmokerIndicator = "No"

Input Data:
- Column: 'Smoking Status' (Assume column exists in DM dataset)

Example:
- Smoking Status: "Current Smoker"
- IsSmokerIndicator (Result): "Yes"
